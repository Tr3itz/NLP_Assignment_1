The space cardioid is a 3-dimensional curve derived from the cardioid. It has a parametric representation using trigonometric functions.


== Definition ==
The general form of the equation is most easily understood in parametric form, as follows:

  
    
      
        X
        (
        t
        )
        =
        (
        (
        k
        +
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        t
        )
        )
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        t
        )
        ,
        (
        j
        +
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        t
        )
        )
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        t
        )
        ,
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        t
        )
        )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X(t)=((k+\cos(t))\cos(t),(j+\cos(t))\sin(t),\sin(t))\,}
