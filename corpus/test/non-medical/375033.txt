In mathematics, trigonometric substitution is the replacement of trigonometric functions for other expressions. In calculus, trigonometric substitution is a technique for evaluating integrals. Moreover, one may use the trigonometric identities to simplify certain integrals containing radical expressions. Like other methods of integration by substitution, when evaluating a definite integral, it may be simpler to completely deduce the antiderivative before applying the boundaries of integration.

=== Examples of Case I ===


==== Example 1 ====
In the integral

we may use

Then,

The above step requires that 
  
    
      
        a
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a>0}
   and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        >
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos \theta >0.}
   We can choose 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   to be the principal root of 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{2},}
   and impose the restriction 
  
    
      
        −
        π
        
          /
        
        2
        <
        θ
        <
        π
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle -\pi /2<\theta <\pi /2}
   by using the inverse sine function.
For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change.  For example, as 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   goes from 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   to 
  
    
      
        a
        
          /
        
        2
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a/2,}
   then 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin \theta }
   goes from 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   to 
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        2
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/2,}
   so 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   goes from 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   to 
  
    
      
        π
        
          /
        
        6.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi /6.}
    Then,

Some care is needed when picking the bounds. Because integration above requires that 
  
    
      
        −
        π
        
          /
        
        2
        <
        θ
        <
        π
        
          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle -\pi /2<\theta <\pi /2}
   , 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   can only go from 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   to 
  
    
      
        π
        
          /
        
        6.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi /6.}
   Neglecting this restriction, one might have picked 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   to go from 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   to 
  
    
      
        5
        π
        
          /
        
        6
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 5\pi /6,}
   which would have resulted in the negative of the actual value.
Alternatively, fully evaluate the indefinite integrals before applying the boundary conditions. In that case, the antiderivative gives
 as before.

Then,

For a definite integral, the bounds change once the substitution is performed and are determined using the equation

    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\sec ^{2}\theta }}=\sec \theta .}
  
Then,

The integral of secant cubed may be evaluated using integration by parts. As a result,

=== Examples of Case III ===
Integrals like

can also be evaluated by partial fractions rather than trigonometric substitutions. However, the integral

cannot.  In this case, an appropriate substitution is:

where 
  
    
      
        a
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a>0}
   so that 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              a
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        =
        a
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {a^{2}}}=a,}
   and 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        θ
        <

    {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta <{\frac {\pi }{2}}}
   by assuming 
  
    
      
        x
        >
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x>0,}
   so that 
  
    
      
        tan
        ⁡
        θ
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tan \theta \geq 0}
   and

        ⁡
        θ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tan ^{2}\theta }}=\tan \theta .}
  
Then,

One may evaluate the integral of the secant function by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 
  
    
      
        (
        sec
        ⁡
        θ

        tan

        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\sec \theta +\tan \theta )}
   and the integral of secant cubed by parts. As a result,

When 
  
    
      
        
          
            π
            2

        π
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}<\theta \leq \pi ,}
   which happens when 
  
    
      
        x
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x<0}
   given the range of arcsecant, 
  
    
      
        tan
        ⁡
        θ
        ≤
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tan \theta \leq 0,}
   meaning 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              tan
              
                2

        tan
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\tan ^{2}\theta }}=-\tan \theta }
   instead in that case.


== Substitutions that eliminate trigonometric functions ==
Substitution can be used to remove trigonometric functions.
For instance,

The last substitution is known as the Weierstrass substitution, which makes use of tangent half-angle formulas.
For example,


== Hyperbolic substitution ==
Substitutions of hyperbolic functions can also be used to simplify integrals.In the integral

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \int {\frac {dx}{\sqrt {a^{2}+x^{2}}}}\,,}
   make the substitution 
  
    
      
        x
