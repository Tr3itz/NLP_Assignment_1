Tubular fluid is the fluid in the tubules of the kidney. It starts as a renal ultrafiltrate in the glomerulus, changes composition through the nephron, and ends up as urine leaving through the ureters.


== Composition table ==
The composition of tubular fluid changes throughout the nephron, from the proximal tubule to the collecting duct and then as it exits the body, from the ureter.
