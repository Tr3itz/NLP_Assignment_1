Bovine Meat and Milk Factors (BMMFs) are DNA molecules found in beef and cow's milk which have been linked to the development of cancerâ€”particularly colorectal and breast cancer.


== Research ==
The potential connection between BMMFs and cancer has been made based on assessments of epidemiological data and the investigation of antibodies in human serum. Research has also suggested a potential link between BMMFs and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis.At the end of 2017, evidence was presented that BMMFs in human cells show long-term survival, through the identification of BMMFs' RNA and protein products. In February 2019, evidence was presented of a previously unknown infectious agent in the blood serum and milk of Eurasian cattle that could indirectly trigger the development of colorectal cancer.
