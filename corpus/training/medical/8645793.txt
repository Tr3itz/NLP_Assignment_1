The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), formerly called the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC or NCI-CTC), are a set of criteria for the standardized classification of adverse effects of drugs used in cancer therapy. 
The CTCAE system is a product of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).
The first Iteration was prior to 1998. In 1999, the FDA released version 2.0. CTCAE version 4.0 in 2009 with an update to y version 4.03 in 2010. The current version 5.0 was released on November 27, 2017. Many clinical trials, now extending beyond oncology, encode their observations based on the CTCAE system.
