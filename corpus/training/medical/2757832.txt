A myotome is the group of muscles that a single spinal nerve innervates. Similarly a dermatome is an area of skin that a single nerve innervates with sensory fibers. Myotomes are separated by myosepta (singular: myoseptum). In vertebrate embryonic development, a myotome is the part of a somite that develops into muscle.


== Structure ==
The anatomical term myotome  which describes the muscles served by a spinal nerve root, is also used in embryology to describe that part of the somite which develops into the muscles.   In anatomy the myotome is the motor equivalent of a dermatome.


== Function ==
Each muscle in the body is supplied by one or more levels or segments of the spinal cord and by their corresponding spinal nerves.  A group of muscles innervated by the motor fibres of a single nerve root is known as a myotome.


=== List of myotomes ===
Myotome distributions of the upper and lower extremity are as follows;
C1/C2: neck flexion/extension
C3: Lateral Neck Flexion
C4: shoulder elevation
C5: Shoulder abduction
C6: Elbow flexion/Wrist Extension
C7: Elbow extension/Wrist flexion
C8: Thumb extension
T1: Finger Abduction & Adduction
L1/L2: Hip Flexion
L3: Knee extension
L4: Ankle dorsi-flexion
L5: Great toe extension
S1: Hip extension/Ankle plantar-flexion/ankle eversion
S2: Knee flexion
S3–S4: anal wink


== Clinical significance ==
In humans myotome testing can be an integral part of neurological examination as each nerve root coming from the spinal cord supplies a specific group of muscles. Testing of myotomes, in the form of isometric resisted muscle testing, provides the clinician with information about the level in the spine where a lesion may be present. During myotome testing, the clinician is looking for muscle  weakness of a particular group of muscles. Results may indicate lesion to the spinal cord nerve root, or intervertebral disc herniation pressing on the spinal nerve roots.
