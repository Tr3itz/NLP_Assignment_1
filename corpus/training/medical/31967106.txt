Nuclear atypia refers to abnormal appearance of cell nuclei. It is a term used in cytopathology and histopathology. Atypical nuclei are often pleomorphic.
Nuclear atypia can be seen in reactive changes, pre-neoplastic changes and malignancy.  Severe nuclear atypia is, in most cases, considered an indicator of malignancy.
