Cardiovascular physiology is the study of the cardiovascular system, specifically addressing the physiology of the heart ("cardio") and blood vessels ("vascular").
These subjects are sometimes addressed separately, under the names cardiac physiology and circulatory physiology.Although the different aspects of cardiovascular physiology are closely interrelated, the subject is still usually divided into several subtopics.


== Heart ==

Cardiac output (= heart rate * stroke volume. Can also be calculated with Fick principle, palpating method.)
Stroke volume (= end-diastolic volume − end-systolic volume)
Ejection fraction (= stroke volume / end-diastolic volume)
Cardiac output is mathematically ` to systole
Inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic states
Cardiac input (= heart rate * suction volume Can be calculated by inverting terms in Fick principle)
Suction volume (= end-systolic volume + end-diastolic volume)
Injection fraction (=suction volume / end-systolic volume)
Cardiac input is mathematically ` to diastole

Electrocardiogram

Cardiac action potential

== Regulation of blood pressure ==

Renin–angiotensin system

Juxtaglomerular apparatus
Aortic body and carotid body
Autoregulation
Cerebral Autoregulation


=== Hemodynamics ===
Under most circumstances, the body attempts to maintain a steady mean arterial pressure.When there is a major and immediate decrease (such as that due to hemorrhage or standing up), the body can increase the following:

Heart rate
Total peripheral resistance (primarily due to vasoconstriction of arteries)
Inotropic stateIn turn, this can have a significant impact upon several other variables:

Stroke volume
Cardiac output
Pressure
Pulse pressure (systolic pressure - diastolic pressure)
Mean arterial pressure (usually approximated with diastolic pressure + 1/3 pulse pressure)
Central venous pressure
