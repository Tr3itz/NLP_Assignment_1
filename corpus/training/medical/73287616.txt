The Biomedical Research Center (BRC) is a research center at Qatar University focusing on biomedical research. BRC was founded in 2014, and partners with the Ministry of Public Health (Qatar), and Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC).


== History ==
The incidence of genetic disorders in Qatar is high, with the top three causes of death in the country cancer, heart diseases and diabetes. The government saw the creation of BRC as a strategy for proactively preventing diseases to foster public health.BRC labs received the ISO/IEC - 17025 accreditation from the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). The centre's research activities focus on the domains of Infectious diseases (Virology and Microbiology), Metabolic disorders, and Biomedical omics.


== Research ==
Since its inauguration in 2014, BRC researchers have published research papers with more than 530 publications.The centre's research projects include:

Antibiotic profiling of antibiotics resistant microbes in humans and animals (One health approach).
Identified for the first time the reason of why some obese people gets type-2 diabetes while others do not.
Conducted six research on COVID-19 to assist in fighting and recovery.
Provided a study on protection against the Omicron variant in Qatar.
Decoded the genetic code of Qatari falcons and various endangered animal species.
DNA sequence of the Dugong (sea cow).
Study a nanomedicine-based preventative strategy to controlling diseases and improve health.


== Zebrafish Research Model ==
BRC Introduced the use of Zebrafish as an animal model in biomedical research at QU and established a facility for it in 2015. The facility is used as a research unit to study many genetic diseases. Therefore, Ministry of Public Health (Qatar) clearly articulated an institutional research policy (IRP) on human use of Zebrafish in research, and QU circulated it to QU community for implementation.


== Facilities ==
The BRC facilities include:
Biosafety level 3 (BSL3) built by CERTEK, USA. It is equipped for viral- and bacterial research on risk group 3 pathogens.
Sequencing unit to conduct state-of-the-art research in genomics.
