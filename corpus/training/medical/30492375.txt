Endocrine oncology refers to a medical speciality dealing with hormone producing tumors, i.e. a combination of endocrinology and oncology.
Few centres are specializing in hormone producing tumors only, due to the relatively low incidence. Most centres have gastroenterologists, oncologist or endocrinologists who deal with other diseases as well. One exception is the Uppsala Centre of Excellence in Neuroendocrine Tumors at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden, where doctors treat only endocrine tumors.
