The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to trigonometry:
Trigonometry – branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the sides and the angles in triangles. Trigonometry defines the trigonometric functions, which describe those relationships and have applicability to cyclical phenomena, such as waves.


== Basics ==
Geometry – mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, the relative position of figures, and the properties of space. Geometry is used extensively in trigonometry.
Angle – the angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane.
Ratio – a ratio indicates how many times one number contains another
