Double-talk is a form of speech in which inappropriate, invented, or nonsense words are interpolated into normal speech to give the appearance of knowledge, and thus confuse or amuse the audience. 
It developed out of dialect comedy and became popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in English-speaking vaudeville and music halls. Vaudevillian Cliff Nazarro, for instance, would say, "Make yourself invidded, with the keforth and the grepps. Be great with the floom and the sonic keptefin."
Comedians who have used this as part of their act include Al Kelly, Danny Kaye, Gary Owens, Irwin Corey, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Lewis, Sid Caesar, Stanley Unwin, Reggie Watts, Vanessa Bayer and Mario "Cantinflas" Moreno Reyes.It has also been used in films, for example Charlie Chaplin's character in The Great Dictator, many of Danny Kaye's patter songs, and Willie Solar's screeching singing in Diamond Horseshoe (1945).
