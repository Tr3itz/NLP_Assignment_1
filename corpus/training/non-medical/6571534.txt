The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to ecology:
Ecology – scientific study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms and how the distribution and abundance are affected by interactions between the organisms and their environment.  The environment of an organism includes both physical properties, which can be described as the sum of local abiotic factors such as solar insolation, climate and geology, as well as the other organisms that share its habitat.  Also called ecological science.


== Essence of ecology ==
Nature – Natural, physical, or material world and its phenomena, or Natural environment – Living and non-living things on Earth
Ecosystem – Community of living organisms together with the nonliving components of their environment, or Biome – Community of organisms associated with an environment
Community (ecology) – Associated populations of species in a given area, or Biocoenosis – Interacting organisms living together in a habitat
Species – Basic unit of taxonomic classification, below genus
Population – All the organisms of a given species that live in a specified region
Organism – Any individual living being or physical living system
Biodiversity – Variety and variability of life forms
Food web – Natural interconnection of food chains


== Other criteria ==
Ecology can also be classified on the basis of:

the primary kinds of organism under study, e.g. animal ecology, plant ecology, insect ecology;
the biomes principally studied, e.g. forest ecology, grassland ecology, desert ecology, benthic ecology, marine ecology, urban ecology;
the geographic or climatic area, e.g. arctic ecology, tropical ecology;
the spatial scale under consideration, e.g. macroecology, landscape ecology;
the philosophical approach, e.g. systems ecology which adopts a holistic approach;
the methods used, e.g. molecular ecology.
