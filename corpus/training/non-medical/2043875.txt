Flattening is a measure of the compression of a circle or sphere along a diameter to form an ellipse or an ellipsoid of revolution (spheroid) respectively. Other terms used are ellipticity, or oblateness. The usual notation for flattening is 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   and its definition in terms of the semi-axes 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   of the resulting ellipse or ellipsoid is

  
    
      
        f
        =
        
          
            
              a
              −
              b
            
            a
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f={\frac {a-b}{a}}.}
  The compression factor is 
  
    
      
        b
        
          /
        
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b/a}
   in each case; for the ellipse, this is also its aspect ratio.


== Definitions ==
There are three variants: the flattening 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,}
   sometimes called the first flattening, as well as two other "flattenings" 
  
    
      
        
          f
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f'}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n,}
   each sometimes called the second flattening, sometimes only given a symbol, or sometimes called the second flattening and third flattening, respectively.In the following, 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   is the larger dimension (e.g. semimajor axis), whereas 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   is the smaller (semiminor axis).  All flattenings are zero for a circle (a = b).

The flattenings can be related to each-other:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                f
                =
                
                  
                    
                      2
                      n
                    
                    
                      1
                      +
                      n
                    
                  
                
                ,
              
            
            
              
                n
                =
                
                  
                    f
                    
                      2
                      −
                      f
                    
                  
                
                .
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f={\frac {2n}{1+n}},\\[5mu]n={\frac {f}{2-f}}.\end{aligned}}}
  The flattenings are related to other parameters of the ellipse. For example,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                    b
                    a
