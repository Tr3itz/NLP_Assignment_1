In trigonometry, trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric functions and are true for every value of the occurring variables for which both sides of the equality are defined. Geometrically, these are identities involving certain functions of one or more angles. They are distinct from triangle identities, which are identities potentially involving angles but also involving side lengths or other lengths of a triangle.
These identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. An important application is the integration of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the substitution rule with a trigonometric function, and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.


== Pythagorean identities ==

The basic relationship between the sine and cosine is given by the Pythagorean identity:

where 
  
    
      
        
          sin
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\theta }
   means 
  
    
      
        (
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\sin \theta )^{2}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          cos
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta }
   means 
  
    
      
        (
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\cos \theta )^{2}.}
  
This can be viewed as a version of the Pythagorean theorem, and follows from the equation 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        +
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=1}
   for the unit circle. This equation can be solved for either the sine or the cosine:

where the sign depends on the quadrant of 
  
    
      
        θ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta .}
  
Dividing this identity by 
  
    
      
        
          sin
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}\theta }
  , 
  
    
      
        
          cos
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos ^{2}\theta }
  , or both yields the following identities:

Using these identities, it is possible to express any trigonometric function in terms of any other (up to a plus or minus sign):


== Reflections, shifts, and periodicity ==
By examining the unit circle, one can establish the following properties of the trigonometric functions.


=== Reflections ===
When the direction of a Euclidean vector is represented by an angle 
  
    
      
        θ
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ,}
   this is the angle determined by the free vector (starting at the origin) and the positive 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  -unit vector. The same concept may also be applied to lines in a Euclidean space, where the angle is that determined by a parallel to the given line through the origin and the positive 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  -axis. If a line (vector) with direction 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   is reflected about a line with direction 
  
    
      
        α
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha ,}
   then the direction angle 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ^{\prime }}
   of this reflected line (vector) has the value

The values of the trigonometric functions of these angles 
  
    
      
        θ
        ,
        
        
          θ
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta ,\;\theta ^{\prime }}
   for specific angles 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   satisfy simple identities: either they are equal, or have opposite signs, or employ the complementary trigonometric function. These are also known as reduction formulae.


=== Shifts and periodicity ===


=== Signs ===
The sign of trigonometric functions depends on quadrant of the angle. If 
  
    
      
        
          −
          π
        
        <
        θ
        ≤
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle {-\pi }<\theta \leq \pi }
   and sgn is the sign function,

The trigonometric functions are periodic with common period 
  
    
      
        2
        π
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\pi ,}
   so for values of θ outside the interval 
  
    
      
        (
        
          −
          π
        
        ,
        π
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({-\pi },\pi ],}
   they take repeating values (see § Shifts and periodicity above).


== Angle sum and difference identities ==

These are also known as the angle addition and subtraction theorems (or formulae).

The angle difference identities for 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        α
        −
        β
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin(\alpha -\beta )}
   and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        α
        −
        β
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos(\alpha -\beta )}
   can be derived from the angle sum versions by substituting 
  
    
      
        −
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle -\beta }
   for 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   and using the facts that 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        −
        β
        )
        =
        −
        sin
        ⁡
        (
        β
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin(-\beta )=-\sin(\beta )}
   and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        −
        β
        )
        =
        cos
        ⁡
        (
        β
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos(-\beta )=\cos(\beta )}
  . They can also be derived by using a slightly modified version of the figure for the angle sum identities, both of which are shown here.
These identities are summarized in the first two rows of the following table, which also includes sum and difference identities for the other trigonometric functions. 


=== Sines and cosines of sums of infinitely many angles ===
When the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i

    {\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\theta _{i}}
   converges absolutely then

Because the series 
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            i

    {\textstyle \sum _{i=1}^{\infty }\theta _{i}}
   converges absolutely, it is necessarily the case that 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          
            i
            →

            i
          
        
        =
        0
        ,
      
    
    {\textstyle \lim _{i\to \infty }\theta _{i}=0,}

        1.
      
    
    {\textstyle \lim _{i\to \infty }\cos \theta _{i}=1.}
    In particular, in these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many angles: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors but there are cofinitely many cosine factors.  Terms with infinitely many sine factors would necessarily be equal to zero.
When only finitely many of the angles 
  
    
      
        
          θ
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta _{i}}
   are nonzero then only finitely many of the terms on the right side are nonzero because all but finitely many sine factors vanish.  Furthermore, in each term all but finitely many of the cosine factors are unity.

using the sine and cosine sum formulae above.
The number of terms on the right side depends on the number of terms on the left side.
For example:

=== Ptolemy's theorem ===

Ptolemy's theorem is important in the history of trigonometric identities, as it is how results equivalent to the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine were first proved. It states that in a cyclic quadrilateral 
  
    
      
        A
        B
        C
        D
      
    
    {\displaystyle ABCD}
  , as shown in the accompanying figure, the sum of the products of the lengths of opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals. In the special cases of one of the diagonals or sides being a diameter of the circle, this theorem gives rise directly to the angle sum and difference trigonometric identities. The relationship follows most easily when the circle is constructed to have a diameter of length one, as shown here.
By Thales's theorem,

These can be shown by using either the sum and difference identities or the multiple-angle formulae.

The fact that the triple-angle formula for sine and cosine only involves powers of a single function allows one to relate the geometric problem of a compass and straightedge construction of angle trisection to the algebraic problem of solving a cubic equation, which allows one to prove that trisection is in general impossible using the given tools, by field theory.A formula for computing the trigonometric identities for the one-third angle exists, but it requires finding the zeroes of the cubic equation 4x3 − 3x + d = 0, where 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the value of the cosine function at the one-third angle and d is the known value of the cosine function at the full angle. However, the discriminant of this equation is positive, so this equation has three real roots (of which only one is the solution for the cosine of the one-third angle). None of these solutions is reducible to a real algebraic expression, as they use intermediate complex numbers under the cube roots.

   the following is true, and can be deduced using De Moivre's formula, Euler's formula and the binomial theorem.


== Product-to-sum and sum-to-product identities ==
The product-to-sum identities or prosthaphaeresis formulae can be proven by expanding their right-hand sides using the angle addition theorems. Historically, the first four of these were known as Werner's formulas, after Johannes Werner who used them for astronomical calculations. See amplitude modulation for an application of the product-to-sum formulae, and beat (acoustics) and phase detector for applications of the sum-to-product formulae.


=== Product-to-sum identities ===


=== Sum-to-product identities ===
The sum-to-product identities are as follows:


=== Hermite's cotangent identity ===

Charles Hermite demonstrated the following identity. Suppose

    {\displaystyle a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}}
   are complex numbers, no two of which differ by an integer multiple of π. Let

(in particular, 
  
    
      
        
          A

== Linear combinations ==
For some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period or frequency but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period or frequency, but a different phase shift. This is useful in sinusoid data fitting, because the measured or observed data are linearly related to the a and b unknowns of the in-phase and quadrature components basis below, resulting in a simpler Jacobian, compared to that of 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   and 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  .


=== Sine and cosine ===

where 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   and 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   are defined as so:

        a
        ≠
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\neq 0.}
  


=== Arbitrary phase shift ===

where 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   and 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   satisfy:

        0

A related function is the Dirichlet kernel:

A similar identity is
The proof is the following. By using the angle sum and difference identities,

Then let's examine the following formula,

and this formula can be written by using the above identity,

So, dividing this formula with 
  
    
      
        2
        sin
        ⁡
        α

   completes the proof.


== Certain linear fractional transformations ==

        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   is given by the linear fractional transformation

and similarly

then

More tersely stated, if for all

        f

   above, then

If 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is the slope of a line, then

        (
        x
        )

        α
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle -\alpha .}
  


== Relation to the complex exponential function ==

Euler's formula states that, for any real number x:
where i is the imaginary unit. Substituting −x for x gives us:

These two equations can be used to solve for cosine and sine in terms of the exponential function.  Specifically,

These formulae are useful for proving many other trigonometric identities.  For example, that
ei(θ+φ) = eiθ eiφ means that

That the real part of the left hand side equals the real part of the right hand side is an angle addition formula for cosine.  The equality of the imaginary parts gives an angle addition formula for sine.
The following table expresses the trigonometric functions and their inverses in terms of the exponential function and the complex logarithm.

The same cosine identity is

Similarly,

Similarly,

The following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables (but see explanation below):

Degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators:

The factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21/2 that are relatively prime to (or have no prime factors in common with) 21. The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the Möbius function evaluated at (in the very last case above) 21; only half of the zeroes are present above. The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively.
Other cosine identities include:
and so forth for all odd numbers, and hence

Many of those curious identities stem from more general facts like the following:
and

The transfer function of the Butterworth low pass filter can be expressed in terms of polynomial and poles. By setting the frequency as the cutoff frequency, the following identity can be proved:


=== Computing π ===
An efficient way to compute π to a large number of digits is based on the following identity without variables, due to Machin. This is known as a Machin-like formula:

or, alternatively, by using an identity of Leonhard Euler:

or by using Pythagorean triples:

Others include:

Generally, for numbers t1, ..., tn−1 ∈ (−1, 1) for which θn = Σn−1k=1 arctan tk ∈ (π/4, 3π/4), let tn = tan(π/2 − θn) = cot θn.  This last expression can be computed directly using the formula for the cotangent of a sum of angles whose tangents are t1, ..., tn−1 and its value will be in (−1, 1).  In particular, the computed tn will be rational whenever all the t1, ..., tn−1 values are rational.  With these values,

where in all but the first expression, we have used tangent half-angle formulae.  The first two formulae work even if one or more of the tk values is not within (−1, 1).  Note that if t = p/q is rational, then the (2t, 1 − t2, 1 + t2) values in the above formulae are proportional to the Pythagorean triple (2pq, q2 − p2, q2 + p2).
For example, for n = 3 terms,

for any a, b, c, d > 0.


=== An identity of Euclid ===
Euclid showed in Book XIII, Proposition 10 of his Elements that the area of the square on the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the sides of the regular hexagon and the regular decagon inscribed in the same circle. In the language of modern trigonometry, this says:

Ptolemy used this proposition to compute some angles in his table of chords in Book I, chapter 11 of Almagest.
