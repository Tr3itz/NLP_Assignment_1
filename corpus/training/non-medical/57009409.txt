This is a list of forms of electricity named after scientists.  The terms in this list are mostly archaic usages but are found in many 19th and early 20th-century publications.


== Adjectives ==
faradic
Of electricity that is alternating, especially when obtained from an induction coil.  Named after Michael Faraday who built the first electromagnetic generator.
galvanic
Of electricity that is not alternating.  Named after Luigi Galvani.
voltaic
Of electricity derived from an electrochemical cell or battery.  Named after Alessandro Volta who built the first battery, the voltaic pile.  In most contexts it can be considered a synonym of galvanic.


== Nouns (applications) ==
Faradization
Electrotherapy treatment of a person with faradic electricity.  Coined by Duchenne de Boulogne and named after Michael Faraday.
Franklinization
Electrotherapy by charging a person to high voltage with static electricity.  Named after Benjamin Franklin.
d'Arsonvalization
Electrotherapy treatment of a person with high frequency electricity.  Named after Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval.


== Nouns (forms) ==
Faradism
Faradic electricity
Franklinism
High voltage static electricity as used in Franklinization
Galvanism
Originally, voltaic electricity, but can also be used to distinguish Galvani's animal electricity from Volta's chemical/metal contact electricity
