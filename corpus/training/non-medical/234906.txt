The following is a list of integrals (antiderivative functions) of trigonometric functions. For antiderivatives involving both exponential and trigonometric functions, see List of integrals of exponential functions. For a complete list of antiderivative functions, see Lists of integrals. For the special antiderivatives involving trigonometric functions, see Trigonometric integral.
Generally, if the function 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin x}
   is any trigonometric function, and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos x}
   is its derivative,

In all formulas the constant a is assumed to be nonzero, and C denotes the constant of integration.
