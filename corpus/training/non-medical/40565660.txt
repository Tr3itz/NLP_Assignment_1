In biodiversity studies, the checkerboard score or C-score is a statistic which determines the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a collection of biomes.  The statistic, first published by Stone and Roberts in 1990, expands on the earlier work of Diamond that defined a notion of "checkerboard distributions" as an indicator of species competition.
A low c-score indicates a higher randomness, i.e. a greater likelihood that the distribution of one species has not been directly affected by the presence of other species.


== Definition and calculation ==
Given two species sp1, sp2 and n islands, an incident matrix is built.
In the 
  
    
      
        2
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\times n}
   incident matrix, each row represents one of the two species and each column represents a different island.
The matrix is then filled with each cell being set to either 0 or 1. Cell with the value of 0 means that a given species doesn't exist in the given island whilst the value of 1 means that the species do exist in the given island.
The calculation of the co-occurrence of two species sp1, sp2 in the given set of islands is done as follows:

  
    
      
        
          C
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        (
        
          r
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          S
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
        (
        
          r
          
            j
          
        
        −
        
          S
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{ij}=(r_{i}-S_{ij})(r_{j}-S_{ij})}
  Cij  - C-score for the two species sp1, sp2 in the given set of islands
Sij - The number of co-occurrences of sp1, sp2
ri  -  Number of islands in which sp1 has 1
rj -  Number of islands in which sp2 has 1The checkerboard score (c-score) for the colonisation pattern is then calculated as the mean number of checkerboard units per species-pair in the community:
For M species, there are P = M(M-1)/2 species-pairs, so C-score is calculated:

  
    
      
        C
        =
        
          ∑
          
            j
            =
            0
          
          
            M
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            i
            <
            j
          
        
        
          C
          
            i
            j
          
        
        
          /
        
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle C=\sum _{j=0}^{M}\sum _{i<j}C_{ij}/P}
  The C-score is sensitive to the proportion of islands that are occupied, thereby confounding comparisons between matrices or sets of species pairs within them.  An extension of the C-score therefore standardizes by the number of islands each species-pair occupies using:

  
    
      
        
          C
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        (
        
          r
          
            i
          
        
        −
        
          S
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
        (
        
          r
          
            j
          
        
        −
        
          S
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
        
          /
        
        (
        
          r
          
            i
          
        
        +
        
          r
          
            j
          
        
        −
        
          S
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{ij}=(r_{i}-S_{ij})(r_{j}-S_{ij})/(r_{i}+r_{j}-S_{ij})}
