In trigonometry, Mollweide's formula is a pair of relationships between sides and angles in a triangle.A variant in more geometrical style was first published by Isaac Newton in 1707 and then by Friedrich Wilhelm von Oppel in 1746. Thomas Simpson published the now-standard expression in 1748. Karl Mollweide republished the same result in 1808 without citing those predecessors.It can be used to check the consistency of solutions of triangles.Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
Let α, β, and γ be the measures of the angles opposite those three sides respectively.  Mollweide's formulas are

The identities can also be proven equivalent to the law of sines and law of cosines.


== Dual relations ==
In spherical trigonometry, the law of cosines and derived identities such as Napier's analogies have precise duals swapping central angles measuring the sides and dihedral angles at the vertices. In the infinitesimal limit, the law of cosines for sides reduces to the planar law of cosines and two of Napier's analogies reduce to Mollweide's formulas above. But the law of cosines for angles degenerates to 
  
    
      
        0
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0=0.}
   By dividing squared side length by the spherical excess 
  
    
      
        E
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle E,}
   we obtain a non-vanishing ratio, the spherical trigonometry relation:

  In the infinitesimal limit, as the half-angle tangents of spherical sides reduce to lengths of planar sides, the half-angle tangent of spherical excess reduces to twice the area 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   of a planar triangle, so on the plane this is:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              c

              γ

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {c^{2}}{2A}}={\frac {\sin \gamma }{\sin \alpha \,\sin \beta }},}
  and likewise for 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and

As corollaries (multiplying or dividing the above formula in terms of

    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  ) we obtain two dual statements to Mollweide's formulas. The first expresses the area in terms of two sides and the included angle, and the other is the law of sines:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              a
              b

              γ
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {ab}{2A}}={\frac {1}{\sin \gamma }},}
  
  
    
      
        
          
            a
            b
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              sin
              ⁡
              α
            
            
              sin

              β
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{b}}={\frac {\sin \alpha }{\sin \beta }}.}
  We can alternately express the second formula in a form closer to one of Mollweide's formulas (again the law of tangents):

  
    
      
        
          
            
              tan

                    1
                    2
                  
                
              
              (
              α
              −
              β
              )
            
            
              cot
              ⁡
              
                
                  
                    1
                    2
                  
                
              
              γ
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              a
              −
              b
            
            
              a
              +
              b
