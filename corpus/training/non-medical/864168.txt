Mains electricity by country includes a list of countries and territories, with the plugs, voltages and frequencies they commonly use for providing electrical power to low voltage appliances, equipment, and lighting typically found in homes and offices. (For industrial machinery, see industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets.) Some countries have more than one voltage available. For example, in North America, a unique split-phase system is used to supply to most premises that works by center tapping a 240 volts transformer. This system is able to concurrently provide 240 volts and 120 volts. Consequently, this allows homeowners to wire up both 240 V or 120 V circuits as they wish (in accordance to code.) Most sockets are connected to 120 V for the use of small appliances and electronic devices. While larger appliances such as dryer, electric oven, range and EV charger use dedicated 240 V sockets. Different sockets are mandated for different voltage or current levels. 
Voltage, frequency, and plug type vary, but large regions may use common standards. Physical compatibility of receptacles may not ensure compatibility of voltage, frequency, or connection to earth (ground), including plugs and cords. In some areas, older standards may still exist. Foreign enclaves, extraterritorial government installations, or buildings frequented by tourists may support plugs not otherwise used in a country, for the convenience of travellers.


== Main reference source – IEC World Plugs ==
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publishes a web microsite World Plugs which provides the main source for this page, except where other sources are indicated. World Plugs includes some history, a description of plug types, and a list of countries giving the type(s) used and the mains voltage and frequency.
Although useful for quick reference, especially for travellers, IEC World Plugs may not be regarded as totally accurate, as illustrated by the examples in the plugs section below, and errors may exist.


== Voltages ==
Voltages in this article are the nominal single-phase supply voltages, or split-phase supply voltages. Three-phase and industrial loads may have other voltages.
All voltages are root mean square voltage; the peak AC voltage is greater by a factor of √2, and the peak-to-peak voltage greater by a factor of 2√2.


== Plugs ==

The system of plug types using a single letter (from A to N) used here is from World Plugs, which defines the plug type letters in terms of a general description, without making reference to specific standards. Where a plug does not have a specific letter code assigned to it, then it may be defined by the style sheet number listed in IEC TR 60083.  Not all plugs are included in the letter system; for example, there is no designation for the plugs defined by the Thai National Standard TIS 116-2549, though some web sites refer to the three-pin plug described in that standard as "Type O".
