The belt problem is a mathematics problem which requires finding the length of a crossed belt that connects two circular pulleys with radius r1 and r2 whose centers are separated by a distance P. The solution of the belt problem requires trigonometry and the concepts of the bitangent line, the vertical angle, and congruent angles.

Clearly triangles ACO and ADO are congruent right angled triangles, as are triangles BEO and BFO. In addition, triangles ACO and BEO are similar. Therefore angles CAO, DAO, EBO and FBO are all equal. Denoting this angle by 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   (denominated in radians), the length of the belt is

  This exploits the convenience of denominating angles in radians that the length of an arc = the radius × the measure of the angle facing the arc.

  For fixed P the length of the belt depends only on the sum of the radius values r1 + r2, and not on their individual values.

== Applications ==
The belt problem is used  in the design of aeroplanes, bicycle gearing, cars, and other items with pulleys or belts that cross each other. The pulley problem is also used in the design of conveyor belts found in airport luggage belts and automated factory lines.
