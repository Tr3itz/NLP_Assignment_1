The compressed cover tree is a type of data structure in computer science that is specifically designed to facilitate the speed-up of a k-nearest neighbors algorithm in finite metric spaces. Compressed cover tree is a simplified version of explicit representation of cover tree that was motivated by past issues in proofs of time complexity results of cover tree.
The compressed cover tree was specifically designed to achieve claimed time complexities of cover tree in a mathematically rigorous way. 


== Problem statement ==
In the modern formulation, the k-nearest neighbor problem is to find all 
  
    
      
        k
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\geq 1}
   nearest neighbors in a given reference set R for all points from another given query set Q. Both sets belong to a common ambient space X with a distance metric d satisfying all metric axioms.

Although cover trees provide faster searches than the naive approach, this advantage must be weighed with the additional cost of maintaining the data structure. In a naive approach adding a new point to the dataset is trivial because order does not need to be preserved, but in a compressed cover tree it can be bounded
