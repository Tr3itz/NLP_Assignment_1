An advanced superionic conductor (AdSIC) in materials science, is fast ion conductor that has a crystal structure close to optimal for fast ion transport (FIT).


== History ==
The term was introduced in a paper by A.L. Despotuli, A.V. Andreeva and B. Rambaby.


== Characteristics ==
The rigid ion sublattice of Advanced SuperIonic Conductors (AdSICs) has structure channels where mobile ions of opposite sign migrate. Their ion-transport characteristics display ionic conductivity of ~0.3/Ω cm (RbAg4I5, 300 K) and activation energy of Ei~0.1 eV. This determines the temperature-dependent concentration of mobile ions ni~Ni x eEi/kBT capable to migrate in conduction channels at each moment (Ni~1022/cm3, ni~2x1020/cm3, 300 K).
The Rubidium silver iodide–family is a group of AdSIC compounds and solid solutions that are isostructural with the RbAg4I5 alpha modification. Examples of such compounds with mobile Ag+- and Cu+-cations include KAg4I5, NH4Ag4I5, K1−xCsxAg4I5, Rb1−xCsxAg4I5, CsAg4Br1−xI2+x, CsAg4ClBr2I2, CsAg4Cl3I2, RbCu4Cl3I2 and KCu4I5.RbAg4I5 AdSIC displays peculiar features of crystal structure and dynamics of mobile ions.Recently, all solid state micrometre-sized supercapacitors based on AdSICs (nanoionic supercapacitors) had been recognized as critical electron component of future sub-voltage and deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies (22 nm technological node of CMOS and beyond). Researchers also developed an all-solid-state battery employing RbAg4I5 superionic conductor.
