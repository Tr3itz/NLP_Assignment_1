The history of blues in New Zealand dates from the 1960s.  The earliest blues influences on New Zealand musicians were indirect – not from the United States but from white British blues musicians: first the R&B styles of Fleetwood Mac, Eric Clapton, The Animals and The Rolling Stones, and later the blues-tinged rock of groups such as Led Zeppelin. The first American blues artist to make a big impact in New Zealand was Stevie Ray Vaughan in the early 1980s. Other blues-related genres such as soul and gospel almost completely by-passed New Zealand audiences, except for a handful of hits from cross-over artists such as Ray Charles.

Gamble settled in Whangarei and at a local youth club began singing country music and Beatles' songs. He worked as a shipping clerk and although his work schedule did not allow for a fulltime music career, he "purchased a Fender Telecaster and Twin Reverb amp" and began playing with local musicians, gradually incorporating more blues material into his routine. In 1974 he formed the band Street Talk and within a year the group was fully professional and highly rated within the New Zealand music scene, playing regularly at the Gluepot Tavern in Auckland. At the time Gamble was noted for his "powerful stage presence" said to have gained the attention of Chris Hillman who saw Street Talk live and late produced their first single, Leaving the Country. After signing to WEA Records, Street Talk recorded a self-titled debut, which was produced by Kim Fowley, and 'Battleground of Fun'. Street Talk disbanded in 1980 and Gamble started the Hammond Gamble Band which released several albums.

In 1992 he had a number-one hit with "You Make the Whole World Smile".
